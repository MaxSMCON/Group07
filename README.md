We are going to use google colab for oup project. I will keep saving the colab notebook here.

**Recap - Sunday Feb 13th, 2022**
All members to look for data sources 
Ramila ws interested in HR Data sets 
Post Data Source on Git Hub 

Jing  - to analyse the data in Power BI for Validity 

Meeting will be schedule every sunday at  6pm . Action Items will be recapped in Git Hub as well as posted on Whatsapp. - Ramila 
Google Colab will be the source for Coding 
Members can add  sections as they add code to the main program. 

Call out from David - Start work on assignment 1 early as the gap between the two assignments is only one week. 

**Recap Meeting February 20th @6pm EST**
Please review the US Census Data Set to predict over 50K - What kind of data exploratory activities can be done 
Also review the Buying pattern data set to see if it can be appended with other data sets out there. 

_Have a data set, if you watn to present it. Else lets preserve our time with what we need to do next. _

Plan of Action  - Data Exploration on the two identified.

**Next Meeting March 27 @6pm EST** - Finialize the data set and prepare Pipeline analysis

# Next Steps
<li> Feature importance (check module 5)
<li> Improve pipeline - Done
<li> Gridsearch - tuning hyper parameters (Panthea)
<li> Different classifiers, cross valdiation (precision, ROC) (code is there)
<li> Unsuperivesd Learning to tune target - in case of low F1 score (it is good to demostrate)
<li> Reduction of dimensionalty on further evaluation of classifiers  (hyper)
<li> Work on vizualization transperancy (David will work)
<li> PCA (0.95) and run classifiers (Sivi)
<li>   
<li> Decision Tree - Gradient Boosting Regressor (Ramila) \  ADA BOOST (Panthea)
